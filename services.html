           <h3>STRATEGY</h3>
           <p>It’s never been easier to build something, and it’s never been harder to build something successful. Strategy is not only the first part of our process, but it’s the point of entry for everything we do.
           During this phase, we refine organizational objectives and requirements, develop online strategy and IA (information architecture), establish project success factors, document project milestones, and complete a formal scope sign-off on all aspects of the project. While we have a bias towards action in everything we do, we also know that uncertainties kill projects. Taking the time to get on the same page always pays off.</p>

           <h3>DESIGN</h3>
           <p>Founded by a pair of designers, and boasting an ever-expanding trophy case, our agency is, at its heart, a design agency. Design guides everything.
           Designs are iterative and presented using interactive tools, allowing our UX team and our clients to interact with simulated functionality quickly.  This allows us to collaborate on the experience of the design to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the navigation, calls to action and overall interactions the site will have.  Clients can take notes directly on the designs as well, saving hours of conversations and emailed feedback.</p>

           <h3>ENGINEERING</h3>
           <p>Our in-house engineering team is nimble enough to help large institutions take advantage of modern technology, while responsible enough to execute in enterprise environments. After leveraging our intensive Discovery process to define all technical and scope aspects of your project, and completing our user experience design process, we transition to technological execution.
           Our team is capable of crafting custom software applications, CMS implementations, mobile apps, and data projects — all through a flexible process, coupled with rigorous launch procedures and QA that help us get it done right.</p>

           <h3>PERFORMANCE</h3>
           <p>It’s one thing for a project to launch; it’s another for it to perform. After we’ve debuted your new presence, we invest ourselves in making it successful. This includes three key areas.
           The first is marketing, where we are Google certified and can help strategize activities ranging from SEO, video production, Paid Search, and social strategies to help drive real traffic.
           The second is support, where our dedicated in-house support team takes care of additional features, security monitoring, questions and bugs.
           The third is UX enhancements, where we lead progressive UX audits and improvements by going through analytics, best practices, conversion tracking, and A/B testing. The saying is old because it’s true: this is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
