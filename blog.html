           </div>
           <div class="blog-text">
               <p>Thailand’s Digital Economy Ministry aims to spend 128.56 million baht ($3.8 million) acquiring software to strengthen the military government’s ability to track online networks and monitor online activity.
               According to Reuters, the software will include a ‘social network data analysis system’, which would monitor and map individuals and relationships of over a million online users. Authorities are increasingly targeting social media for violations of a law that makes it a crime to insult or threaten the king, queen or heir to the throne.“The software will sweep and store all data available on social media to be analysed and monitored,” Teerawut Thongpak, director of the ministry’s Digital Service Infrastructure Department, told Reuters.
               Thongpak confirmed that the government would post a tender for the software and then consider offers.</p>

           </div>
           <div class="blog-text">
               <p>The growth in unmanaged devices owned by employees or contractors is driving adoption of stand-alone mobile application management (MAM) software and services, according to a new report.The need to manage applications on unmanaged devices owned by employees or contractors is driving adoption of stand-alone mobile app management (MAM) software and services, according to a new Gartner report.
               By 2021, 60% of mobile apps being used in the enterprise will rely on at least one app-level management control, whether on managed or unmanaged devices, Gartner's Market Guide for Mobile Application Management said.
               Unlike MAM tools that are part of a larger enterprise mobility management (EMM) suite, the use of stand-alone MAM licensing offers lower per-user cost and can be attractive for companies only requiring app management, Gartner said. For other firms, EMM provides the advantage of a single console and policy set.</p>

           </div>
           <div class="blog-text">
               <p>AMD appears willing to go the distance to make sure everyone gets a running Ryzen APU system.If you can't get your shiny new Ryzen APU on the motherboard you bought last year, don't panic: AMD officials have confirmed that they will indeed ship you an older, dual-core chip to help you make it work.
               The problem relates to AMD's new Ryzen APU and how it interacts with older stocks of motherboards. It's a classic chicken-and-egg situation: Some older motherboards won't recognize the new Ryzen APU without a BIOS update. And the only way to update that BIOS is to boot the system with a chip that it recognizes.
               While some advanced motherboards allow updating a BIOS without a CPU, many budget boards don't. For those few cases, AMD said it would offer a "boot kit" (once you've provided a qualifying APU serial number and other information). That "boot kit," as it turns out, is actually an AM4-based Bristol Ridge APU. In a post by "Hansmuffin" at tech site arstechnica.com, a user wrote that AMD was sending a previous-generation APU to help perform the update.</p>
